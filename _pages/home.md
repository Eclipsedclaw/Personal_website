### Indirect Dark Matter Search

Indirect dark matter search aims to detect the byproducts of dark matter particle interactions rather than the particles themselves. When dark matter particles, like hypothetical Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), interact with ordinary matter or annihilate with each other, they can produce standard particles such as electrons, positrons, photons, or neutrinos that can be detected.

##### Project involved: GAPS
GAPS (General Antiparticle Spectrometer) experiment is one of the indirect dark matter search experiments. It aims to detect low-energy antideuterons, which are rare in the cosmic ray spectrum and are expected to be produced in dark matter annihilations or decays. By looking for an excess of antideuterons in cosmic rays, GAPS could potentially identify signatures of dark matter.

##### Project involved: GRAMS
GRAMS (Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey) is a proposed balloon/satellite mission that will
be the first to target both MeV gamma-ray observations and antimatter-based indirect dark
matter searches with a LArTPC (Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber) detector. We are
currently building and testing a prototype detector, MiniGRAMS, that will be employed for
the first balloon flight proposed in the mid-2020s.
Aside from dark matter search, GRAMS will also be the first in flight mission that operate as Liquid Argon Time projection Chamber(LArTPC). It will target on the gamma-ray MeV gap to bring back a lof of new discoveries.

These experiments exemplify indirect approaches to uncovering dark matter by searching for its secondary products rather than directly detecting the elusive dark matter particles.
